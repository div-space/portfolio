## **About the Project**

**Title:** PrepAnywhere (MGL)

**Extent of the project:** 7 months, Part-time

When the world went remote, personalized student support became a real challenge. Schools struggled to address varying learning gaps, and students lacked the one-on-one attention they needed to shine. So, I teamed up with PrepAnywhere (MGL) to create their new web app. We made it with step-by-step videos and online study groups. We worked with them to figure out what their new Automated Tutor Service could do. We looked at new and existing services they could offer, and we figured out how to bring their teaching methods into the digital world.
